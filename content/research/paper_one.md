<b>Abstract:</b> One unique aspect of the marriage tradition in Chinese society is the presence of bidirectional wealth transfers: bride price and dowry---a payment from the groom's family to the bride's family and from the bride's family to the couple, respectively. Under this institution, this article delves into the broad implication of a pro-women marriage law amendment related to property division in divorce in a society with high gender inequality. I first complement the existing marriage market models by relaxing the assumption of a single zero-sum payment. The model incorporates bargaining processes between the parents on the two sides and within the couple, relying on patrilocality and altruism as the rationales. Empirically, using a collective model and reduced-form evidence, I first find that a larger dowry improves the wife's bargaining power within the new conjugal household. Then with RDD estimation, I find that the 2001 amendment leads to discontinuities in the two prices. This article attests to a policy implication of how a one-sided targeting policy can lead to a Pareto improvement---the increase in the bride price and dowry benefits both the couple and the bride's family.
