<br> <p style="line-height:120%; font-size: 15px"> <b>Abstract:</b> I propose a refined Chiappori-style collective model to explore how degenderization influences labor allocation within same-sex couples. This study addresses the shortcomings of Becker and Gronau’s time allocation theory, which inadequately explains labor behaviors among same-sex couples solely through comparative advantages. A gender-neutral collective model is introduced to accommodate shifts away from traditional gender norms. In this framework, gay men show reduced aversion to household tasks, while lesbian women exhibit decreased aversion to paid work. Consequently, gay men are likely to allocate less labor to market work and more to home production, while lesbian women are expected to allocate more labor to market work and less to home production. With a narrower intra-household bargaining power gap, same-sex couples tend toward a more balanced distribution of labor between paid work and housework. Empirical evidence from the British Household Panel Survey supports this theoretical framework, highlighting its relevance in understanding labor dynamics within same-sex partnerships.</p>

<br> <p style="line-height:120%; font-size: 15px"> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper investigates how enhancing women’s property rights can improve the welfare of both spouses. It examines the effects of a change in marriage law that protects wives’ property rights in the event of a divorce. The study focuses on a unique marriage institution prevalent in China where the bride’s family sets a bride price and provides a dowry to the new couple. The model takes into account patrilocal residence and parental altruism towards their children. The couple divides their income and the dowry, with the dowry playing a crucial role in determining the allocation of resources. The study derives equilibrium prices for marriage payments. It shows that increasing the wife’s property rights leads to a Pareto improvement if the bride price increases. Using a regression discontinuity design, I show that the law encourages larger dowries and bride prices and thus financially benefits both the husband and wife.</p>

<br> <p style="line-height:120%; font-size: 15px"> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper studies how legal statuses and gendered preferences impact intra-household allocations, focusing on China’s household registration system known as <i>hukou</i>. The <i>hukou</i> system determines access to public services and reflects the strength of local social networks. A person’s <i>hukou</i> status can often be changed through marriage. This unique context allows us to explore how external policies and societal factors influence household decisions. Using a collective model and data on household consumption and spouses’ <i>hukou</i> statuses, we find that <i>hukou</i> status plays a crucial role in determining within-family bargaining power. Wives with more advantageous <i>hukou</i> statuses, sometimes transferable to their husbands, wield significantly greater bargaining power compared to others but still less than their husbands. We identify substantial differences in preferences between husbands and wives, especially regarding goods associated with gender roles, such as alcohol, tobacco, and clothing.</p>

The burden of crime victimisation among the LGBTQ+ population in Aotearoa
<br> <p style="line-height:120%; font-size: 15px"> <b>Abstract:</b>This paper examines how crime victimization among LGBTQ+ individuals differs from that experienced by non-LGBTQ+ counterparts, with a particular focus on the severity of consequences. The study acknowledges that LGBTQ+ individuals face unique challenges and discrimination that are not encountered by non-LGBTQ+ people. Discrimination affects the LGBTQ+ community, which includes individuals who are not heterosexual and/or express diverse gender identities such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or others.</p>
