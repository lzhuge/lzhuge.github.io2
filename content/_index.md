<big>Hello there. 

I'm Liqun (pronounced Lee-Chun), an economics PhD student at Boston University. My fields are labor and development economics. My research explores the source of inequality at the household level, particularly the barriers presented by policies, social norms, and cultures. My job market paper studies a unique marriage tradition involving bidirectional marriage payments in China and the broad implication of a pro-woman marriage law amendment in a society with high gender inequality.

I am currently on the job market and am available for interviews.<big>
