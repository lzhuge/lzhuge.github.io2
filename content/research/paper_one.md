<b>Abstract:</b> This article delves into a conservative marriage tradition in Chinese society that involves bidirectional wealth transfers: bride price and dowry, and the broad implication of a pro-women marriage law amendment in a society with high gender inequality. In spite of marital transfers being a tradition derived from history with unequal gender roles, this article first probes the economic rationales behind the two transfers from the groom's family to the bride's family (bride price) and from the bride's family to the couple (dowry). Secondly, I provide evidence on how dowry impacts the intrahousehold bargaining power within the new conjugal households. Lastly, I utilize the 2001 marriage law amendment as a natural experiment to discuss how a one-sided targeting policy can lead to a Pareto improvement for all sides. To answer these questions, I construct a theoretical model that involves the bargaining process on both parents and children's sides. I provide empirical evidence with reduced-form and structural model estimation methods to test the theory. The empirical results show significant support for the predictions from the models.
