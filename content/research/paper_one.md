<b>Abstract:</b> One unique aspect of the marriage tradition in Chinese society is the presence of both a bride price, paid by the groom's family to the bride's, and a dowry, paid by the bride's family to the couple. This article develops a model in which the bride's family sets the bride price and then transfers the dowry to the new couple, who then divide their resources. Critically, the groom's family receives services from the bride since the couple typically relocates near his family, and both sets of parents are altruistic towards their children. I derive the equilibrium of the marriage payment prices. Empirically, using both a structural collective model and reduced-form evidence, I show that a larger dowry increases the wife's bargaining power within a new conjugal household. Then using regression discontinuity, I examine the effects of a new law protecting the wife's property rights in the event of divorce. By increasing dowry values, this law encourages larger dowries and financially benefits both the husband and wife, as demonstrated by the positive effect on the bride price as well as the dowry.
