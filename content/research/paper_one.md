<b>Abstract:</b> This article delves into a conservative marriage tradition in China that involves two-direction marital transfers: bride price and dowry. Three questions are raised in this article: what and how do family characteristics affect the payments, what are the impacts of the marriage payments on the intrahousehold bargaining power within the new conjugal households, and how does a pro-women marriage law reform affect the dowry payment? To answer these questions, I first construct a theoretical model that involves a bargaining process on the parents' side where children’s welfare is also taken into ac- count. Secondly, I raise a collective model for the married couple to investigate how dowry impacts a wife’s bargaining power. I provide empirical evidence with methods of both reduced-form and struc- tural model estimation to test the predictions from the theoretical models. The empirical results show significant support for the predictions of the models.
