<big>Hello there. 

I'm Liqun (pronounced Lee-Chun), an economics PhD student at Boston University. My fields are labor and development economics. My research focuses on how social barriers lead to gender inequality and discrimination at the household level. My job market paper studies a unique marriage tradition involving bidirectional marriage payments in China and the broad implication of a pro-woman marriage law amendment in a society with high gender inequality.

I am currently on the job market and am available for interviews.<big>
