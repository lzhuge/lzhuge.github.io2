<b>Abstract:</b> This article delves into a conservative marriage tradition in China that involves two-direction marital transfers: bride price and dowry. Three main questions are raised in this article: the rationales behind the wealth transfers from the groom's family to the bride's family (bride price) and from the bride's family to the couple (dowry), and what are the impacts of the marriage payments on the intrahousehold bargaining power within the new conjugal households? To answer these questions, I first construct a theoretical model that involves a bargaining process on the parents' side where children's welfare is also taken into account. Secondly, I raise a collective model for the married couple to investigate how dowry impacts a wife's bargaining power. I provide empirical evidence with methods of both reduced-form and structural model estimation to test the predictions from the theoretical models. The empirical results show significant support for the predictions of the models.
