<big>Hello there. 

I'm Liqun (pronounced Lee-Chun), a fifth-year economics PhD student at Boston University. My fields are labor economics and corporate finance. My main research explores the source of inequality at the household level, particularly the barriers presented by policies, social norms, and cultures. I employ various methodologies in my research, including applied theory and structural and reduced-form estimation. I also excel in multiple programming languages and I am experienced in cluster computing. 

I am currently on the job market and am available for interviews.<big>
