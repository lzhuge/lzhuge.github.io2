<b>Abstract:</b> This paper investigates how enhancing women’s property rights can improve the welfare of both spouses. It examines the effects of a change in marriage law that protects wives' property rights in the event of a divorce. This paper develops a model of a unique marriage institution prevalent in China. The bride’s family sets a bride price, then gives a dowry to the new couple. The couple shares their income and the dowry unless they divorce. In the model, the groom's family gains directly from the marriage since, in China, couples typically relocate near the groom's family. Both sets of parents are altruistic towards their children. The study derives equilibrium prices for marriage payments. It shows that increasing the wife's property rights leads to a Pareto improvement if the bride price increases. Using a regression discontinuity design, I show that the law encourages larger dowries and bride prices and thus financially benefits both the husband and wife.
