My field is labor economics, with a primary focus on inequality and discrimination, particularly in the context of women's and LGBTQ+ rights. My research examines how social norms, cultural dynamics, and policy landscapes shape intrahousehold bargaining and labor supply choices. My proficiencies encompass the skillful handling of micro-level household and personal data, adept application of quantitative econometric methodologies, and versatile programming proficiency across multiple languages and computing paradigms."
