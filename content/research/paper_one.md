<b>Abstract:</b> This article delves into a conservative marriage tradition in Chinese society that involves bidirectional wealth transfers: bride price and dowry. Under this unique institution, I examine the broad implication of a pro-women marriage law amendment regarding property division in divorce in a society with high gender inequality, considering only dowries are in the form of physical assets. Conditional on marital transfers being a tradition derived from history with unequal gender roles, this article first probes patrilocality and altruism as the rationales behind the two transfers: one from the groom's family to the bride's family (bride price) and the other one from the bride's family to the couple (dowry). To do that, I construct a theoretical model that involves the bargaining process between the parents on the two sides and between the spouses. Secondly, I investigate how dowry impacts the intrahousehold bargaining power within the new conjugal households with a collective model and reduced-form evidence. Lastly, I utilize the 2001 marriage law amendment as a natural experiment to discuss how a one-sided targeting policy can lead to a Pareto improvement for all sides.
